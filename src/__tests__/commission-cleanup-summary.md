# Commission Tables Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the cleanup performed for old commission table components as part of task 11 in the commission-tables-update specification.

## Files Removed

### 1. Unused Calculator Components
- **`src/components/calculators/PABXSIPCalculator_Copy.tsx`** - Removed
  - This was a copy/backup file of the PABX calculator
  - Not referenced anywhere in the codebase
  - Safe to remove

- **`src/components/calculators/VMCalculator_fixed.tsx`** - Removed
  - This was an alternative version of the VM calculator
  - Not referenced anywhere in the codebase
  - The main `VMCalculator.tsx` is still in use by `VMProposals.tsx`
  - Safe to remove

## Files Analyzed and Kept

### 1. Commission-Related Types
- **`src/lib/types.ts`** - CommissionData interface kept
  - Still used by `PABXSIPCalculator.tsx` for internal calculations
  - This interface serves a different purpose than the new unified commission system
  - The PABX calculator uses both the old CommissionData for calculations AND the new CommissionTablesUnified for display
  - Required for backward compatibility

### 2. Active Commission Components
All current commission-related components are actively used and properly integrated:

- **`src/components/calculators/CommissionTablesUnified.tsx`** - Main unified component
- **`src/components/calculators/ChannelSellerTable.tsx`** - Individual table component
- **`src/components/calculators/ChannelInfluencerTable.tsx`** - Individual table component
- **`src/components/calculators/ChannelIndicatorTable.tsx`** - Individual table component
- **`src/components/calculators/SellerTable.tsx`** - Individual table component
- **`src/components/calculators/DirectorTable.tsx`** - Individual table component

### 3. Commission Hook and Utilities
- **`src/hooks/use-commissions.ts`** - Main commission data hook
- All utility functions for commission rate calculations
- All TypeScript interfaces for commission data types

## Import Analysis

### ✅ All Calculator Files Using New System
Verified that all 5 main calculators are properly using the new unified commission system:

1. **InternetFibraCalculator.tsx** - ✅ Uses CommissionTablesUnified
2. **InternetManCalculator.tsx** - ✅ Uses CommissionTablesUnified
3. **RadioInternetCalculator.tsx** - ✅ Uses CommissionTablesUnified
4. **PABXSIPCalculator.tsx** - ✅ Uses CommissionTablesUnified
5. **MaquinasVirtuaisCalculator.tsx** - ✅ Uses CommissionTablesUnified

### ✅ No Old Commission Component References
- No references to old commission table components found
- No unused imports detected
- All commission-related imports are using the new unified system

## Test Files Status

### ✅ All Test Files Current
- All commission-related test files are current and testing the new system
- No test files referencing removed components
- Test coverage remains comprehensive

## Database and Migration Files

### ✅ Database Files Preserved
- `supabase-commissions-schema.sql` - Kept (part of new system)
- `supabase-update-commissions.sql` - Kept (part of new system)
- `scripts/deploy-commission-tables.js` - Kept (deployment script for new system)

## Package.json Scripts

### ✅ Test Scripts Preserved
- `test:commission` script kept - useful for running commission-related tests
- No unused dependencies found

## Summary of Changes

### Removed Files (2)
1. `src/components/calculators/PABXSIPCalculator_Copy.tsx`
2. `src/components/calculators/VMCalculator_fixed.tsx`

### Files Analyzed and Confirmed as Needed
- All current commission components and utilities
- CommissionData interface (still used by PABX calculator)
- All database migration files
- All test files
- All deployment scripts

## Verification Steps Completed

1. ✅ Searched for all commission-related components
2. ✅ Verified all calculator imports use new unified system
3. ✅ Confirmed no references to removed files exist
4. ✅ Validated that all test files are current
5. ✅ Checked for unused dependencies
6. ✅ Verified database files are part of new system

## Result

The commission tables cleanup is complete. All old, unused commission table components have been removed while preserving:
- The new unified commission system
- Backward compatibility for PABX calculator's internal calculations
- All necessary database and deployment files
- Comprehensive test coverage

The codebase is now clean and uses the unified commission table system consistently across all calculators.

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application is experiencing a Firebase Firestore error when users attempt to save proposals. The error indicates that a composite index is required for queries on the `proposals` collection that filter by `userId` and `baseId` fields. This prevents users from properly saving and retrieving their proposals, which is a critical functionality for the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save my proposals without encountering database errors, so that I can store and manage my work effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user saves a proposal THEN the system SHALL successfully store the proposal in Firestore without index errors
2. WHEN a user queries their saved proposals THEN the system SHALL return results without requiring additional indexes
3. IF the required index does not exist THEN the system SHALL provide clear error handling and guidance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to retrieve my saved proposals filtered by user and base ID, so that I can access my specific proposals efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests their proposals THEN the system SHALL query by userId and baseId fields efficiently
2. WHEN multiple users have proposals THEN the system SHALL only return proposals belonging to the requesting user
3. WHEN proposals are retrieved THEN the system SHALL maintain proper ordering and pagination support

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Firestore indexes to be properly configured, so that all proposal queries work without runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN all required Firestore indexes SHALL be configured
2. WHEN new query patterns are added THEN the system SHALL identify and create necessary indexes
3. IF an index is missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation on how to create it

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle database errors gracefully, so that I receive helpful feedback when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Firestore index error occurs THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms where appropriate
3. WHEN errors are encountered THEN the system SHALL log sufficient information for debugging
